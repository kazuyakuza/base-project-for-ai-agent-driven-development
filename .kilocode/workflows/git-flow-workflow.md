# Git Flow Workflow

## 1. Start a New Task
- Switch to the `main` branch.
- Create a new branch with a descriptive name:
  - For new features: `feat/<meaning-name>`
  - For bug fixes: `fix/<meaning-name>`

## 2. Development
- Work on the feature branch.
- Make commits with meaningful messages.

## 3. Finish a Task
- Ensure all files are committed.
- Merge the feature branch into the `main` branch.
- Switch to the `main` branch.
- Delete the feature branch.
