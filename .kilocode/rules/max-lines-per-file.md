# Max Lines per File Rule

## Guidelines

- Files should be kept as short as possible to improve readability and maintainability.
- As a general rule, files should not exceed 200 lines.
- Excluding blank lines, comments, and import statements, files should ideally be under 125 lines.
- This rule may not apply to certain types of files where longer length is unavoidable.
