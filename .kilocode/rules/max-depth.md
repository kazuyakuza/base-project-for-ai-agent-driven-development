# Max Depth Rule

## Guidelines

- The maximum indentation level within a file or method should be limited to improve readability.
- As a general rule, the maximum depth of nested blocks should not exceed two levels.
- If a third level of nesting is required, the logic should be extracted into a separate method or function.
- The indentation count starts from the beginning of the file or the body of a method/function.
