# Workflow Adherence Rule

## Guidelines

- Before proceeding with any process or rule, the AI agent must verify if a defined workflow exists for that specific task.
- If a workflow exists, the agent must follow it strictly.
- If no workflow exists, the agent is free to handle the process or rule as it deems appropriate.
