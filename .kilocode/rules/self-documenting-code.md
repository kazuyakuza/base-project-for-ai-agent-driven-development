# Self-Documenting Code Rule

## Guidelines

- Code should be written in a way that is easy to understand without the need for extensive comments.
- Use clear and descriptive names for files, classes, methods, variables, and other code elements.
- Prefer self-documenting code over adding comments.
- Minimal comments are acceptable, especially for complex business logic or to provide high-level explanations of modules or classes.
