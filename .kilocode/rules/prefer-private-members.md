# Prefer Private Members Rule

## Guidelines

- Members (properties, methods, etc.) should be defined as private by default.
- Only expose members as public when it is absolutely necessary for the functionality of the application.
- This principle helps to encapsulate the internal logic of a class or module and reduce the public API surface.
