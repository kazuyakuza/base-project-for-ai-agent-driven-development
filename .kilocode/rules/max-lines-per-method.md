# Max Lines per Method Rule

## Guidelines

- Methods and functions should be kept as short as possible to improve readability and testability.
- The body of a method or function should not exceed 50 lines.
- This count excludes the method/function signature (name, parameters, return type, etc.).
- This rule may not apply in specific cases where a longer method is unavoidable.
